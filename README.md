# Patient Service Analysis Tool

The Patient Service Analysis Tool (PSAT) is a system that is used to store and analyse patient feedback using Azure services. Comments provided by patients are analysed using sentiment analysis to generate a score between 0 and 1. These scores along with other feedback are visualised using Power BI to provide insights into what a hospital is doing well and where improvements need to be made.

The Power BI file included has a pre-set bunch of visualisations that allow hospitals to see what clinics are performing well and what clinics need improving. Key features include a time sentiment graph to track changes over time, a page allowing you to compare multiple clinic's performances to each other or track a single clinic's performance over time and a page allowing you to see common words and phrases that appear in comments and see comments containing those words.

## Installation and Usage

For details on how to set up and use the system please see the provided Deployment and User Manual PDFs.
